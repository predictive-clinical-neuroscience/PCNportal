            Normative modelling is an emerging technique for parsing heterogeneity in clinical cohorts. This can be implemented in practice using hierarchical Bayesian regression, which provides an elegant probabilistic solution to handle site variation in a federated learning framework. However, applications of this method to date have employed a Gaussian assumption, which may be restrictive in some applications. We have extended the hierarchical Bayesian regression framework to flexibly model non-Gaussian data with heteroskdastic skewness and kurtosis. To this end, we employ a flexible distribution from the sinh-arcsinh (SHASH) family, and introduce a novel reparameterisation that is more suitable for Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling than existing variants. Using a large neuroimaging dataset collected at 82 different sites, we show that the results achieved with this extension are better than a warped Bayesian linear regression baseline model on most datasets. We also demonstrate that the attained flexibility is essential for accurately modelling highly nonlinear relationships between aging and imaging derived phenotypes, which shows that the extension is important for pushing the field of normative modelling forward.

	abstract = {Normative modelling is becoming more popular in neuroimaging due to its ability to make predictions of deviation from a normal trajectory at the level of individual participants. It allows the user to model the distribution of several neuroimaging modalities, giving an estimation for the mean and centiles of variation. With the increase in the availability of big data in neuroimaging, there is a need to scale normative modelling to big data sets. However, the scaling of normative models has come with several challenges. So far, most normative modelling approaches used Gaussian process regression, and although suitable for smaller datasets (up to a few thousand participants) it does not scale well to the large cohorts currently available and being acquired. Furthermore, most neuroimaging modelling methods that are available assume the predictive distribution to be Gaussian in shape. However, deviations from Gaussianity can be frequently found, which may lead to incorrect inferences, particularly in the outer centiles of the distribution. In normative modelling, we use the centiles to give an estimation of the deviation of a particular participant from the ‘normal’ trend. Therefore, especially in normative modelling, the correct estimation of the outer centiles is of utmost importance, which is also where data are sparsest. Here, we present a novel framework based on Bayesian linear regression with likelihood warping that allows us to address these problems, that is, to correctly model non-Gaussian predictive distributions and scale normative modelling elegantly to big data cohorts. In addition, this method provides likelihood-based statistics, which are useful for model selection. To evaluate this framework, we use a range of neuroimaging-derived measures from the UK Biobank study, including image-derived phenotypes (IDPs) and whole-brain voxel-wise measures derived from diffusion tensor imaging. We show good computational scaling and improved accuracy of the warped BLR for certain IDPs and voxels if there was a deviation from normality of these parameters in their residuals. The present results indicate the advantage of a warped BLR in terms of; computational scalability and the flexibility to incorporate non-linearity and non-Gaussianity of the data, giving a wider range of neuroimaging datasets that can be correctly modelled.},

            Normative models are a class of emerging statistical techniques useful for understanding the heterogeneous biology underlying psychiatric disorders at the level of the individual participant. Analogous to normative growth charts used in paediatric medicine for plotting child development in terms of height or weight as a function of age, normative models chart variation in clinical cohorts in terms of mappings between quantitative biological measures and clinically relevant variables. An emerging body of literature has demonstrated that such techniques are excellent tools for parsing the heterogeneity in clinical cohorts by providing statistical inferences at the level of the individual participant with respect to the normative range. Here, we provide a unifying review of the theory and application of normative modelling for understanding the biological and clinical heterogeneity underlying mental disorders. We first provide a statistically grounded yet non-technical overview of the conceptual underpinnings of normative modelling and propose a conceptual framework to link the many different methodological approaches that have been proposed for this purpose. We survey the literature employing these techniques, focusing principally on applications of normative modelling to quantitative neuroimaging-based biomarkers in psychiatry and, finally, we provide methodological considerations and recommendations to guide future applications of these techniques. We show that normative modelling provides a means by which the importance of modelling individual differences can be brought from theory to concrete data analysis procedures for understanding heterogeneous mental disorders and ultimately a promising route towards precision medicine in psychiatry.},

              Psychopathology is rooted in neurodevelopment. However, clinical and biological heterogeneity, together with a focus on case-control approaches, have made it difficult to link dimensions of psychopathology to abnormalities of neurodevelopment. Here, using the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, we built normative models of cortical volume and tested whether deviations from these models better predicted psychiatric symptoms compared to raw cortical volume. Specifically, drawing on the
              p-factor
              hypothesis, we distilled 117 clinical symptom measures into six orthogonal psychopathology dimensions: overall psychopathology, anxious-misery, externalizing disorders, fear, positive psychosis symptoms, and negative psychosis symptoms. We found that multivariate patterns of deviations yielded improved out-of-sample prediction of psychopathology dimensions compared to multivariate patterns of raw cortical volume. We also found that correlations between overall psychopathology and deviations in ventromedial prefrontal, inferior temporal, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortices were stronger than those observed for specific dimensions of psychopathology (e.g., anxious-misery). Notably, these same regions are consistently implicated in a range of putatively distinct disorders. Finally, we performed conventional case-control comparisons of deviations in a group of individuals with depression and a group with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We observed spatially overlapping effects between these groups that diminished when controlling for overall psychopathology. Together, our results suggest that modeling cortical brain features as deviations from normative neurodevelopment improves prediction of psychiatric symptoms in out-of-sample testing, and that
              p-factor
              models of psychopathology may assist in separating biomarkers that are disorder-general from those that are disorder-specific.},

              Background
              The present paper presents a fundamentally novel approach to model individual differences of persons with the same biologically heterogeneous mental disorder. Unlike prevalent case-control analyses, that assume a clear distinction between patient and control groups and thereby introducing the concept of an ‘average patient’, we describe each patient's biology individually, gaining insights into the different facets that characterize persistent attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
            
            
              Methods
              Using a normative modeling approach, we mapped inter-individual differences in reference to normative structural brain changes across the lifespan to examine the degree to which case-control analyses disguise differences between individuals.
            
            
              Results
              At the level of the individual, deviations from the normative model were frequent in persistent ADHD. However, the overlap of more than 2\% between participants with ADHD was only observed in few brain loci. On average, participants with ADHD showed significantly reduced gray matter in the cerebellum and hippocampus compared to healthy individuals. While the case-control differences were in line with the literature on ADHD, individuals with ADHD only marginally reflected these group differences.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Case-control comparisons, disguise inter-individual differences in brain biology in individuals with persistent ADHD. The present results show that the ‘average ADHD patient’ has limited informative value, providing the first evidence for the necessity to explore different biological facets of ADHD at the level of the individual and practical means to achieve this end.},
