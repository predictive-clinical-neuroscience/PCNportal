Our [Predictive Clinical Neuroscience group](https://predictiveclinicalneuroscience.com/) at the Donders Institute and RadboudUMC develops normative models to predict and stratify brain disorders on the basis of neuroimaging data, and you can now make use of those models for your research in the click of a button. 

**Why are normative models so important for neuroimaging?**
Clinical heterogeneity makes case-control studies insufficient to fully understand brain dysfunction, and normative models are a highly effective way to deal with this individual variability. These models can be developed using our [PCNtoolkit](https://github.com/amarquand/PCNtoolkit): a highly flexible modeling framework that can handle multi-site data, and only requires knowledge of basic Python programming to implement. Nevertheless, developing high-quality normative models takes considerable resources. Moreover, large neuroimaging training data sets are necessary to harness the power of normative models which forms a considerable bottleneck, as for all big data models. _Learn more about normative modelling, and how to develop your own models with PCNtoolkit [here](https://pcntoolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/pcntoolkit_background.html)._

**How does this website help me with normative modeling?**
This website makes it trivial to run normative models pre-trained on tens of thousands of brain images from many different data collection sites. You can now make use of all of our available models in a few clicks, requiring no technical background or compute power, and only a data set of choice. With minimal effort, you can derive subject level statistics for further analysis and find out how well your neural biomarkers match the normative patterns we provide as a function of  covariates such as age and gender.

Happy modelling!
