Here you can find general information about our available models. The models have been trained on extensive data sets with thorough parameter tuning. A subset of these models have also formed the basis of published work.
The model names contain information of their learning configurations, and can be viewed per data type. The data types currently supported can be found under 'Data type' in the 'Compute here!' tab. **Model-specific information is provided upon choosing a data type from the dropdown menu.**

The model name follows the syntax *"{alg}\_{name}\_{sample}\_{n}sites"*:
* alg = algorithm (options: HBR, BLR)
* name = description of the model
* sample = training sample size (e.g. 10K is 10.000 subjects)
* n = amount of unique training data collection sites

Example: 'BLR_lifespan_57K_82sites' makes use of the Bayesian Linear Regression algorithm, across the human lifespan, trained on ~57.000 subjects from 82 different collection sites.

Please note: the number of available models is constantly growing, and more data types will continue to be supported. Let us know about specific requests on [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/PCNportal/community.svg)](https://gitter.im/PCNportal/community?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge).

We welcome model contributions from other groups. Please contact us on Gitter if would like to discuss options to do so.
