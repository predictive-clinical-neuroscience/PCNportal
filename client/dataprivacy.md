## Data Privacy

We take the necessary precautions to limit who can access your data and keep it secure. Here we explain how we take care of your data privacy and security so you can feel comfortable with using our services.

After submitting your data to PCNportal, the files are transferred to a dedicated storage system at the Donders Institute, Center for Cognitive Neuroimaging, through a secure connection (an SSH connection). In this storage system, only our core development team and the Center's IT team have access to your data for purposes like debugging and development.

When your results are obtained any other subject information is removed, and the results are pseudoanonymously shared to a public server. We say pseudoanonymous because a subject's z-scores form a unique fingerprint, but cannot in itself be used to retrieve a subject's identity.

Upon sharing the results with your email address, our email server automatically saves the email address. We will not use it for any other purpose than to send the results, unless specific permission is provided by the user.

We aim to ensure that your data is treated with the most privacy while maintaining a optimally functional pplication. If you have any questions or concerns, please let us know through the contact details mentioned on the home page (including Gitter) and our experts in data privacy will be happy to help.
